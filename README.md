Galaxy Watch 4 derived ECG 30-s segments / Currently on designing daily measurement protocols / Any ideas are welcome

ECG segments measured on a daily basis

Current goals: 
1. Rough approach for crawling self-derived-data: 
  After lunch, I usally go out for a(And for the most, 2-korean cigarrettes) smoke. ECG measurements are made before smoke, and after smoke. 
2. Multi personnel ECG measurement and separation
3. Patient derived data and NFT tokenizing for Patients to recieve rewardings, whom are the true owners of the data. 
4. ...
Sampling rate of 500Hz, 30-second segments. After a short rumbling in baseline, remarkable fiducial R-peaks can be visuallized. 

Need to be updated a lot more.
